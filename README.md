Image Resizer
Image Resizer is a Craft plugin that resizes your assets when they are uploaded. This allows huge images to be resized so as not to use up unnecessary disk space, but still kept at a reasonable resolution. This plugin is not a replacement for using image transforms throughout your site.

# ToDo's
- Add plugin template (not only widget)
- Do Ajax submit
- Optional redirect
